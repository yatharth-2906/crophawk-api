I've modified the code to focus on detecting yellow coloring at the edges of leaves. Here are the key changes and additions:

Added a new function detect_edges:

This function implements a simple edge detection algorithm using Sobel filters.
It converts the image to grayscale, applies Sobel filters in both x and y directions, and combines the results to create an edge mask.


Modified calculate_edge_yellowness (previously calculate_yellowness):

Now takes both the leaf mask and edge mask as inputs.
Combines these masks to focus only on the edges of leaves.
Calculates yellowness only for pixels that are both part of a leaf and on an edge.


Updated detect_leaf_edge_yellowness (previously detect_leaf_yellowness):

Now includes the edge detection step.
Passes both leaf mask and edge mask to the yellowness calculation function.



This implementation should be more sensitive to yellowing at the edges of leaves, which can be an early indicator of certain plant health issues.
Some limitations and potential improvements:

The edge detection is fairly basic. More advanced edge detection algorithms could improve accuracy.
The thresholds for leaf color and edge detection are fixed. Adaptive thresholding could make the algorithm more robust to different lighting conditions and leaf types.
This method doesn't distinguish between different types of leaf edges (e.g., natural leaf margins vs. damaged areas).
The algorithm doesn't account for the overall context of the image, so it might be fooled by non-leaf yellow objects near edges.




2nd iteration



updated the code to incorporate triangulated masks for improved accuracy. Here are the key changes and additions:

Added a new function create_triangulated_mask:

This function takes the binary leaf mask as input and creates a triangulated mask.
It uses Delaunay triangulation to create a mesh that approximates the shape of the leaves.
The function randomly selects a subset of points from the leaf mask to keep the computation manageable.
Corner points are added to ensure full coverage of the image.


Modified detect_leaf_edge_yellowness:

Now creates a triangulated mask based on the initial leaf mask.
Uses the triangulated mask instead of the binary mask for edge detection and yellowness calculation.


Updated calculate_edge_yellowness:

Now uses the triangulated mask instead of the binary leaf mask.



These changes should improve the accuracy of our leaf edge detection in several ways:

Better leaf shape approximation: The triangulated mask can better represent the actual shape of leaves, including curved edges and complex structures.
Reduced noise: By using a subset of points for triangulation, we can reduce the impact of noise in the initial leaf mask.
Improved edge detection: The triangulated mask can help distinguish between actual leaf edges and internal leaf structures or background elements.
Adaptive to different leaf shapes: This method can adapt to various leaf shapes without needing to pre-define specific shape parameters.

Potential further improvements:

Adaptive point selection: Instead of random point selection, we could use a method that prioritizes points along the leaf edges or high-contrast areas.
Multi-scale analysis: We could perform the triangulation at multiple scales to capture both fine details and overall leaf structure.
Color-based triangulation: We could incorporate color information into the triangulation process to better distinguish between different parts of the leaf.
Machine learning integration: We could use a trained model to improve the initial leaf segmentation before triangulation.
Temporal analysis: If working with multiple images over time, we could track changes in the triangulated structure to detect progressive yellowing.
